Data Integrity and Security with Hashing Techniques
This project demonstrates essential hashing techniques using MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512 to verify data integrity and ensure the authenticity of files such as reports.txt. Hashing is a fundamental component in cybersecurity for detecting tampering, maintaining data integrity during transfer and storageâ€”whether in cloud environments or on-premise systems.

Key Highlights:

Implementation and comparison of MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512 hashing algorithms
Explanation of their roles in data verification and security
Best practices for selecting secure hashing methods for sensitive data
Emphasis on the importance of strong hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-512 over MD5 for enhanced security
This project aims to strengthen understanding of how hashing techniques contribute to safeguarding digital information, maintaining trust, and improving cybersecurity defenses.
